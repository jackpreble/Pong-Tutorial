The base game of this file is based on this tutorial: https://www.101computing.net/pong-tutorial-using-pygame-getting-started/

Only step in setting this up is to run the files in PyCharm Pro.

The player's paddle is the paddle on the left side of the screen (Paddle A). The player uses W to move the paddle up
and S to move the paddle down.

The other paddle is the AI's paddle. It won't lose.

Also ignore "data.csv" and "racecar.png"... I just can't get rid of them.
